OpenBTS requires a configuration database, OpenBTS.db.

In an intitial installation, OpenBTS.db is created from OpenBTS.example.sql.

To do that:

sh> sqlite3 OpenBTS.db
sqlite3> .read OpenBTS.example.sql
sqlite3> .quit

Done!

BTW: If OpenBTS.db already exists, you will need to delete that file before doing this procedure.
